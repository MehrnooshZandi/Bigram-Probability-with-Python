# Bigram-Probability-with-Python
In this Repository we calculate bigram probability with Python.
Bigrams help provide the conditional probability of a token given the preceding token, when the relation of the conditional probability is applied:

{\displaystyle P(W_{n}|W_{n-1})={P(W_{n-1},W_{n}) \over P(W_{n-1})}}P(W_{n}|W_{{n-1}})={P(W_{{n-1}},W_{n}) \over P(W_{{n-1}})}

That is, the probability {\displaystyle P()}P() of a token {\displaystyle W_{n}}W_{n} given the preceding token {\displaystyle W_{n-1}}W_{{n-1}} is equal to the probability of their bigram, or the co-occurrence of the two tokens {\displaystyle P(W_{n-1},W_{n})}P(W_{{n-1}},W_{n}), divided by the probability of the preceding token.
